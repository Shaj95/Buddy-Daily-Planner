# Buddy - A Daily Planner Python Project
This repository contains a Python Project focussed on creating a basic daily planner application for my university project

# Overview

As we know, it is extremely important to look after our physical and mental well-being. It enables us to perform better in our academics, at work, in our hobbies as well as in our social life.

Therefore, I wanted to make a project that is a comprehensive planner but also provides emotional support. Hence why I have decided that “Buddy” would be an appropriate name for it because it essentially plays the role of a best friend but one that is extremely versatile, consistent and able to execute important tasks for you.

Buddy collects information such as subjects, hobbies, food, and music you listen to when relaxing. Throughout the day, Buddy then advises you how to distribute time for your academics, but also reminds you to make time for yourself in between that work, based on your interests and music choices. I felt that an app like this would be very useful but also very convenient.

Finally, buddy checks up on you every evening and depending on your responses, Buddy will provide you with emotional support and recommendations you can use to improve the situation.

# How To Run

Download the project on to your computer. Open the file in your IDE of choice.

Ensure that all files have been downloaded and are present in the project folder when you have opened the project in the IDE of your choice.

The main program to run is called ‘Term_Project.py’

Upon running, there should not be any errors that indicate any file is missing.

The project runs entirely in the console as text at the moment, I do wish to include a GUI in future.

1.	The main program to run is called ‘Term_Project.py’
2.	The program draws from a Class called Data, and also draws from separate function files and a data text file for emotional support.
3.	Provide the appropriate information when prompted
4.	It randomly picks a meal, hobby and 7 songs to cater to your day
5.	I have written food data and songs on the next pages of this Word Doc that can be quickly pasted into the prompts in order to save time as there are a lot of prompts for food and songs.
6.	Tips for when buddy asks how your day is going: refer to ‘Buddy_data.txt’ to get an idea of the sort of keywords that are being utilized to generate varying responses.
For eg: responding with something like “I had a fight with a friend” or “I miss my family” or “I am fine” result in different recommendations.
7.	When prompted for meals input the data one by one for example: 
French Toast
260, 1.25
(That is “meal name” followed by caloric value, cost)
I have pasted several meals below for ease of copy pasting into the prompts to save time.
8.	There is no Class method that uses itself as an attribute as there is no information value to change as such, except potentially meal data but it would have taken me long to model that.

# Code Complexity

I intend to keep the complexity low but effective, and yet demonstrate some prowess. Possibly use some unique code implementations/tools.

Can possibly use a system to measure time, memory and energy usage (later).

This is currently a very basic project that does not utilize data structures because it was my first project that was developed during my intense Master's Program, before i learned data structures. I may also include a GUI for this program in future.

# Code Maintainability, Readability and Reusability

Code should be loosely coupled. Should be able to demonstrate the addition of code/variables, reuse older code (such as reader),
The code should be well segmented, naming conventions. Minimize smells.

However, the code quality is not ideal as this was produced in my first semester - before i learned about code smells, refactoring or Design Patterns. A better demonstration of this is the Race Strategy Simulator Application I made in Java (in my repositories). 

In future, I plan to refactor a lot of the code in this Python project as well as apply data structure usage and more checks and balances to prevent incorrect input etc.
